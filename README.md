# python_snacks
 <p>This is a collection of useful code snippets I have used in different situations. I have lost most of the cool 
 things I had but now I am going to save them here as I move on.</p>
 <p>As for the license, you can use anything here under public domain. However, I will be thankful if you mention this 
 repo. Nevertheless, there is absolutely no obligations.</p>
